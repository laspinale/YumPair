# YumPair UI

This is a static Next.js UI prototype for **YumPair**, a playful food pairing community where cooks can post pairings and rate each other.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies (requires access to npm registry):

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Run the dev server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open http://localhost:3000 to see the UI.

> Note: This project currently contains only UI scaffolding—no backend or persistence.
